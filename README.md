## Improvements

<p>I created this app using CRA which is fast and efficient considering I only spent a few hours on this.</p>
<p>The existing implementation is too clutterred which will result in poor user experience.</p>
<p>Therefore I removed the mobile drop down menu and replaced it with a slider that showcases all videos for each category.</p>
<p>This is inspired by the Netflix model for a more cleaner look.</p>
<p>I also placed the search bar lower down so that it's together with the other videos.</p>

<p>If I had more time I would have created the search bar functionality as well as added in the social icons for the top bar.
Currently it's a screenshot.</p>
<p>Finally if I had more time I would create a skeleton loader to act like a placeholder whilst videos are loading in the background.</p>
